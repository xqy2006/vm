# WebVM

This repository hosts the source code of for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

<img src="assets/welcome_to_WebVM_slim.png" width="70%">

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It's designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# How to: general usage

- go to [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io)
- use the provided terminal environment
- have fun!

# How to: enable networking

- go to [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io)
- click "Tailscale Login" in the top right corner
- log in to Tailscale (create an accout if you don't have one)
- if you want to access the public internet, you need an Exit Node. See [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/) for how to set one up. If you just want to access a machine in your Tailscale Network, you don't need it
- depending on your network speed, you may need to wait a few moments for the Tailscale Wasm module to be downloaded
- log in with your Tailscale credentials
- go back to the WebVM tab. You will see your IP address in the top right
- start firing network requests!
